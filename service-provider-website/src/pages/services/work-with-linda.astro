    <p class="lead text-xl text-gray-600 mb-6">
        I work with founder-led and franchisee businesses who are ready for their next chapter of either growth, stabilisation or scale but need sharper strategy, stronger systems, cleaner workflow and better performance to get there.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        My work sits in that rare space where my role is to help you with your own clarity and then execution, whether that is you, your team or me doing the execution.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        I help owners step out of the noise, see the whole board, decide what actually matters, so they can build a business that runs cleanly, profitably and sustainably.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        I’ve spent more than two decades working across finance, operations, people, culture, product-based businesses, licensing and franchise models, software, advisory and small business. Earlier in my career, my husband and I built and sold several businesses, including one acquired by a publicly listed Australian company. That experience shaped the way I think about scale, value creation, commercial discipline and the true cost of growth.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        I’ve grown teams, built systems from scratch, supported exits, navigated restructures, mentored leaders, and guided owners through the messy middle stages where everything feels too fast, too heavy or too uncertain.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Small businesses value the speed and pragmatism. Medium-sized businesses value the commercial insight. Everyone values having someone in their corner who can carry weight without needing a full-time seat at the table.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        As a Fractional Transformation Lead, I can step in part-time to reshape how a business performs across strategy, systems, structure, people, capacity and delivery. It’s the impact of a senior operator without the overhead, and the speed of a small-business mindset applied to organisations that want results sooner rather than later.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        My work is grounded, human and direct. I help founders breathe again, see clearly and make confident decisions.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Alongside my consulting work, I’m also the founder of BodFood, our clean, Australian-made haircare brand. Building BodFood keeps my strategic work deeply practical, everything I teach, I also apply. Product development, cashflow, supply chain, team, customer experience, creative direction, marketing, wholesale.. It's all part of my lived experience and current life. And because BodFood is intentionally an independent Indie brand, I still handwrite every note that goes out with each order, whether it’s for a long-time online customer or a stockist on the other side of the country.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        It’s steady, deliberate work that reminds me every day that small touches still matter and that old school connection and intention have great impact and meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        This dual life of strategist and creative maker gives me a cross-section of insight founders value. I understand the pressure, the pace, the decisions and the emotional load because I live them myself.
