    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto mb-20 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-6">
        <p>
            I work with founder-led and franchisee businesses who are ready for
            their next chapter of either growth, stabilisation or scale but need
            sharper strategy, stronger systems, cleaner workflow and better
            performance to get there.
        </p>

        <p>
            My work sits in that rare space where my role is to help you with
            your own clarity and then execution, whether that is you, your team
            or me doing the execution.
        </p>

        <p>
            I help owners step out of the noise, see the whole board, decide
            what actually matters, so they can build a business that runs
            cleanly, profitably and sustainably.
        </p>

        <p>
            My work is grounded, human and direct. I help founders breathe
            again, see clearly and make confident decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a Fractional Transformation Lead, I can step in part-time to
            reshape how a business performs across strategy, systems, structure,
            people, capacity and delivery. It’s the impact of a senior operator
            without the overhead, and the speed of a small-business mindset
            applied to organisations that want results sooner rather than later.

                Experience & Track Record
            </h3>

            <p>
                I’ve spent more than two decades working across finance,
                operations, people, culture, product-based businesses, licensing
                and franchise models, software, advisory and small business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier in my career, my husband and I built and sold several
                businesses, including one acquired by a publicly listed
                Australian company. That experience shaped the way I think about
                scale, value creation, commercial discipline and the true cost
                of growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve grown teams, built systems from scratch, supported exits,
                navigated restructures, mentored leaders, and guided owners
                through the messy middle stages where everything feels too fast,
                too heavy or too uncertain.

                full-time seat at the table."

            The Founder Perspective
        </h3>

        <p>
            Alongside my consulting work, I’m also the founder of BodFood, our
            clean, Australian-made haircare brand. Building BodFood keeps my
            strategic work deeply practical, everything I teach, I also apply.
        </p>
        <p>
            Product development, cashflow, supply chain, team, customer
            experience, creative direction, marketing, wholesale.. It's all part
            of my lived experience and current life. And because BodFood is
            intentionally an independent Indie brand, I still handwrite every
            note that goes out with each order, whether it’s for a long-time
            online customer or a stockist on the other side of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s steady, deliberate work that reminds me every day that small
            touches still matter and that old school connection and intention
            have great impact and meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
            This dual life of strategist and creative maker gives me a
            cross-section of insight founders value. I understand the pressure,
            the pace, the decisions and the emotional load because I live them
            myself.

                    This work is rooted in deeper, identity-level work for

                    Often founders are drawn to this type of work when they
                    recognise they are the bottleneck. If this sounds like you,

                    actually need before engaging in strategic advisory.
