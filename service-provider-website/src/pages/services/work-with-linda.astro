            I work with founder-led and franchisee businesses who are ready for
            their next chapter of either growth, stabilisation or scale but need
            sharper strategy, stronger systems, cleaner workflow and better
            performance to get there.

                    My work sits in that rare space where my role is to help you

                    you, your team or me doing the execution.

                    I’ve spent more than two decades working across finance,
                    operations, people, culture, product-based businesses,
                    licensing and franchise models, software, advisory and small
                    business.

                <p>
                    Earlier in my career, my husband and I built and sold
                    several businesses, including one acquired by a publicly
                    listed Australian company. That experience shaped the way I
                    think about scale, value creation, commercial discipline and
                    the true cost of growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve grown teams, built systems from scratch, supported
                    exits, navigated restructures, mentored leaders, and guided
                    owners through the messy middle stages where everything
                    feels too fast, too heavy or too uncertain.

                    The Founder Perspective
                </h3>
                <div class="space-y-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    <p>
                        Alongside my consulting work, I’m also the founder of
                        BodFood, our clean, Australian-made haircare brand.
                        Building BodFood keeps my strategic work deeply
                        practical, everything I teach, I also apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Product development, cashflow, supply chain, team,
                        customer experience, creative direction, marketing,
                        wholesale.. It's all part of my lived experience and
                        current life. And because BodFood is intentionally an
                        independent Indie brand, I still handwrite every note
                        that goes out with each order, whether it’s for a
                        long-time online customer or a stockist on the other
                        side of the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s steady, deliberate work that reminds me every day
                        that small touches still matter and that old school
                        connection and intention have great impact and meaning.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This dual life of strategist and creative maker gives me a
                    cross-section of insight founders value. I understand the
                    pressure, the pace, the decisions and the emotional load
                    because I live them myself.
