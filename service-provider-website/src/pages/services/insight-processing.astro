        Insight Processing aims to help the broker improve efficiency and profitability by taking away from the broker or their admin team the hassle, tedium, and drudgery of doing their own Submissions and loan processing.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
        Since 2006, Insight Processing has proudly operated with a 100% Australian-based team. Our experienced and knowledgeable team work across all aggregator groups in Australia, bringing a deep understanding of local lending processes and industry standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Insight Processing takes over loan submission and/or the processing of the loan; dealing with the lender at all points of the process; obtaining instructions either from the broker or from the client direct. We remove the back office headache, client follow up, gathering outstanding documents and keep the borrower client and broker informed electronically and personally throughout the process.
