In the words of Robert Collier, “Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out.” This principle rings especially true in relationship building. Consistency, often overlooked, is what transforms initial connections into lasting partnerships.

## Why Consistency Matters

1.  **Builds Trust**: When you show up regularly—through check-ins, value-driven communication, or simply being present—you demonstrate reliability.

2.  **Maintains Engagement**: Relationships can grow stale without consistent effort. Staying top-of-mind ensures your partners and clients feel valued.

3.  **Drives Momentum**: Sporadic efforts create peaks and valleys, while consistency builds a steady stream of opportunities.

## How to Be Consistent Without Burnout

*   **Automate Where Possible**: Use tools or services like the Broker Growth Framework to manage ongoing communication.

*   **Create a Schedule**: Set aside specific times weekly or monthly for relationship-building activities.

*   **Focus on Quality, Not Quantity**: A consistent approach to a smaller, more targeted group often yields better results than trying to engage everyone at once.

Consistency isn’t glamorous, but it’s powerful. It transforms fleeting connections into strong, enduring partnerships. Remember, successful people do the things that others won’t.
